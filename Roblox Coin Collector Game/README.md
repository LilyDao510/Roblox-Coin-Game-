# Roblox Coin Collector

A Roblox game where players run around the map collecting glowing coins to earn points. Scores are synced to a Python backend that maintains a persistent global leaderboard across all sessions.

## Gameplay

- 20 spinning coins are scattered across the map at all times
- Touch a coin to collect it and earn **+10 points**
- Collected coins respawn after 3 seconds
- Your Score and Coins collected are shown in the top-left HUD
- The global leaderboard board in the world displays the top 10 players

## How to Play

### Objective
Collect as many coins as possible to climb the global leaderboard. Every coin you touch adds to your score — the higher your score, the higher your rank.

### Controls

| Action | Control |
|---|---|
| Move | `W` `A` `S` `D` or Left Stick |
| Jump | `Space` or `A` button |
| Camera | Mouse / Right Stick |

### Step-by-step

1. **Spawn in** — your score starts at 0. The HUD in the top-left corner shows your live Score and Coin count.
2. **Find a coin** — golden spinning discs are spread across the map. They glow so they are easy to spot from a distance.
3. **Walk into it** — touching a coin collects it instantly and adds **+10 points** to your score.
4. **Keep collecting** — each coin respawns at a random spot after **3 seconds**, so there are always coins available.
5. **Check the leaderboard** — walk up to the leaderboard board in the world to see the top 10 global scores from all sessions.
6. **Beat the top score** — your personal best is saved to the backend even after you leave. Come back and try to reclaim the #1 spot.

### HUD

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  ★  Score    1 250  │
│  ◉  Coins      125  │
└─────────────────────┘
```

- **Score** — total points earned this session
- **Coins** — total coins collected this session

### Tips

- Coins respawn at random positions, so keep moving instead of camping one spot
- Multiple players share the same coins — if another player grabs it first, move on
- Your score is saved automatically when you leave, so every session counts toward the global leaderboard

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Game engine | Roblox Studio |
| Game scripting | Lua / Luau |
| Backend | Python + Flask |
| Data format | JSON |
| Storage | Flat-file (`scores.json`) |

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Runs on http://localhost:5000
```

### Roblox Studio

1. Enable HTTP requests: **Game Settings > Security > Allow HTTP Requests = ON**
2. Copy scripts to their destinations:

| File | Destination |
|---|---|
| `CoinGame.server.lua` | `ServerScriptService` |
| `GlobalLeaderboard.server.lua` | `ServerScriptService` |
| `HUD.client.lua` | `StarterPlayerScripts` |

3. Add a `Part` to `Workspace` named `LeaderboardBoard` — the leaderboard GUI renders on its front face
4. Set `BACKEND_URL` in both server scripts to your Flask server address

> **Local testing:** Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to create a public tunnel:
> ```bash
> ngrok http 5000
> # Copy the https URL into BACKEND_URL
> ```
